Python-ExploratoryDataAnalysis-and-Visualization-on-Automobile

Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Automobile Dataset using Python programming language. The project focuses on:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 * Loading and understanding the dataset
 * Cleaning and preprocessing the data
 * Statistical analysis and data visualization
2. Data Visualization
 * Creating insightful visualizations using various libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
 * Exploring relationships between variables
 * Identifying trends and patterns in the data


Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Automobile Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about various car models, including:
 * Features:
   * Make, model, and year
   * Fuel type, engine size, and horsepower
   * Price, mileage, and other specifications

Code Structure
The repository includes the following files:
 * Automobile (1).csv: The original dataset file.
 * Cheatsheet to Exploratory Data Analysis.pdf: A helpful reference for EDA techniques.
 * Python_Lab_Exercises.ipynb: Notebook containing Python exercises.
 * data visualization.ipynb: Notebook demonstrating data visualization techniques.
 * pandas kaggle automobile dataset.ipynb: Notebook focusing on data analysis using Pandas.
 * This file, providing an overview of the project.
Getting Started

 * Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

 * Run the Jupyter Notebooks:
   * Open the notebooks and execute the code cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
