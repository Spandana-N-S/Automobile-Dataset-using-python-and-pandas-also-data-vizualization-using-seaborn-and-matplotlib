Project Name - EDA Automobile Data Analysis
Project Type - EDA
Contribution - Individual
Project Summary -
In the highly competitive automotive industry, understanding the variables that influence car prices is crucial for manufacturers, dealerships, and consumers. This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset of automobile attributes to uncover insights into what drives the pricing dynamics of cars in the market.

Dataset Overview

The dataset contains a wealth of information about cars, encompassing technical specifications, performance metrics, and descriptive features. Key attributes include 'symboling' (insurance risk rating), 'normalized-losses', 'make' (manufacturer), 'fuel-type', 'aspiration', 'num-of-doors', 'body-style', 'drive-wheels', 'engine-location', 'wheel-base', 'length', 'width', 'height', 'curb-weight', 'engine-type', 'num-of-cylinders', 'engine-size', 'fuel-system', 'bore', 'stroke', 'compression-ratio', 'horsepower', 'peak-rpm', 'city-mpg', 'highway-mpg', and 'price'.

Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the factors influencing car prices. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, our goal is to provide actionable insights that help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, product development, and consumer trends.
